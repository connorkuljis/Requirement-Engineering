# Requirements Engineering

*In this unit I learned that gathering requirements for a project are of crucial importance in project - and very hard to get right the first time.*

Requirements from the customer are often vague and change over time (the customer often doesn't really know what they want), and some requirements sound good on paper but can not make sense in the real world application. 


Learned in this unit:
* Methodoly and application of suitable requirement elicitation techniques
* Relevant modeling diagrams to show aspects of the system.

**Conclusion:** In the future as someone who writes software, clear requirements can have a 10x effect on how quick it takes to get the work done - thus the I can see why in industry - most of the time is spent in meetings, rather than head-down coding sessions (a programmers dream).
